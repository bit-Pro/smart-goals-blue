# SMARTgoals
Use the issues tracker for this repo to discuss each of the following goals. You are to assess how SMART each one is, and decide whether it can be used as-is or needs to be changed.

Once you have decided, each member of your group should be assigned a goal to rewrite and must make a new branch to make changes.

All changes must be merged back in using a pull request that is to be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.

### Goals to review:

1. Hold a meeting
2. Attend every single meeting this semester
3. Improve my writing in the PP2 class by the end of semester
